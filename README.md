# Piggy Bank
A program that represents a piggy bank, allowing you to save coins to a certain capacity. Using Object Oriented Programming, the piggy bank stores Coin objects to determine the amount of money there is. A specific property of this piggy bank is that it can expand its capacity certain times. When it has no more expansions and it fills up, it will break and "explode". This program helped me immensely in my understanding of Object Oriented Programming.

This was a project for the CS 300: Programming II course at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, taught by Prof. Laura Legault.
